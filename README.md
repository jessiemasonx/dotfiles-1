At first I didn't understand it that well, but later on when I started to read the articles, I started to understand it much better!

# What I did for this assignment
* Added an welcome message in my terminal: Hello Nina! Nice to see you again!
* Changed my command prompt to: ðŸš€  ninavanbergen :
* Added an alias, only did one because I am just starting to learn all this and I want to add more later on.
